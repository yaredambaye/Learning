## Javascript refresher

<br/>

**var** -> syntax used to declare a variable. This has global scope and it is bad practice to use it as it might cause unexpected errors and hard to identify bugs. <br/><br/>
**let** -> The main difference between let and var is that scope of a variable defined with let is limited to the block in which it is declared while variable declared with var has the global scope. So we can say that var is rather a keyword which defines a variable globally regardless of block scope.<br/><br/>
**const** -> used to declare something we assign once and never change.
